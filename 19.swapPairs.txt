https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/description/

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]

Example 2:
Input: head = []
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]

Example 4:
Input: head = [1,2,3]
Output: [2,1,3]

            second = first.next

            # Swapping
            first.next = second.next
            second.next = first
            prev.next = second

            # Move prev two nodes ahead
            prev = first

        return dummy.next
